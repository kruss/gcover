gcover is a ruby gem to generate gcov code-coverage for unit-tests within a workspace.

unit-tests must be compiled and executed with the following flags:

C++ Compiler:   -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage
C++ Linker:     -fprofile-arcs

to run gcover a folder structure like the folowing is assumed:

<workspace>
  '-\ <project>
	  |-\ <sources>     -> source folders
	  |-\ <config>      -> config folders (containing object and gcov files)
	  '-\ <test>        -> test related sources (excluded from code-coverage)	

usage: gcover <workspace> [options ...]
=> results are stored in .gcover folder within workspace.

NOTE 

per default gcov is executed in config-folders as required for eg. eclipse builds,-
to use gcover for lake builded projects us -l option to execute gcov from project-folders
