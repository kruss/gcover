gcover is a ruby gem to generate gcov code-coverage for cppunit-tests 
and display results in html-files.

cppunit-test configurations must be compiled and executed with the following flags:

C++ Compiler: 	-fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage
C++ Linker:		-fprofile-arcs

folder structure like the folowing is required to run gcover:

<workspace>
  '-\ <project>
	  |-\ <sources>		-> header & source folders
	  |-\ 'test'		-> test related stuff excluded from code-coverage	
	  '-\ <configs>		-> build configurations containing object-files
  ...

usage: gcover <workspace-folder> [<output-folder>]
