gcover is a ruby gem to generate gcov code-coverage for cppunit-tests 
and display results in html-files.

cppunit-test configurations must be compiled and executed with the following flags:

C++ Compiler: 	-fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage
C++ Linker:		-fprofile-arcs

to run gcover a folder structure like the folowing is required:

<workspace>
  '-\ <project>
	  |-\ <sources>		-> source folders
	  |-\ 'test'		-> test related sources (excluded from code-coverage)	
	  '-\ <output>		-> output folders (containing object and gcov files)

usage: gcover -w <workspace-folder> [-o <output-folder>]
